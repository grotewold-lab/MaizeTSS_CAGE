# MaizeTSS_CAGE

This is the main site of the project, please visit each branch acoording to each required code 

1. Build the BSgenome for all the maize genomes: AGPv3, AGPv4, AGPv5 and Mo17 
2. Quality, Trimming and mapping analysis of CAGE libraries
3. BAM to BigWig format suitable for downstream analysis using CAGEr and CAGEfightR 
4. 5'UTR isoforms in B73 and Mo17 inbreds, Dominant TSS, Alternative TSS, TSS annotation and shape description 
5. PROMPTs, lncRNA and eRNA description using CAGE intergenic and bidirectional expression
5. CAGE visualization scripts
